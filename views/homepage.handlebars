      Hello, and welcome to my page
    </h4>
    <br>

    <p class="ebrima">
      I am a full-stack developer working primarily with Javascript and many of it's popular front and back end tools
      and extensions. Having worked in the rapidly changing audio-visual and lighting world for the past decade has
      prepared me to learning rapidly, be resourceful, and adjust easily to changes and issues as the come up. With a
      long and extensive career in both technician and high level management roles, I understand the need for finding
      people who will not only strengthen, but challenge and compliment your team.
